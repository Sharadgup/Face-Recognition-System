## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**: Ensure Python is installed.
- **pip**: Python package manager.

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Face-Recognition-System.git
   cd Face-Recognition-System
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Activate on macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # Activate on Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage üí°

### Running the Application

1. **Launch the Backend Server:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open the Web Interface:**

   Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your web browser.

3. **Interact with the System:**

   Use the web interface to upload images or live streams and see face recognition in action!

### Code Snippets

Here‚Äôs a quick example of how the backend handles a simple request:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
